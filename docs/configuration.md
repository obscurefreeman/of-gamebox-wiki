In this step, please note:

1. If you can't install it due to network problems, you can search for GModCEFCodecFix installation tutorials online. Alternatively, you can try searching for tutorials on how to use **Play X**, as **Play X** also requires CEFCodecFix.
2. If you still can't start the game after installation, the installation may be interrupted, please open `GModCEFCodecFix-Windows.exe` to continue to repair. Please **close** Gmod and try several times!
